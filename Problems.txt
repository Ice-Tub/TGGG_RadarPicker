Some fields in the LayerData and metadata .mat files should not be used for further analysis as they are outdated and not updated by the picker anymore. These fields are: 

- layers_relto_surface
- layers_topo
- layers_topo_depth
- pickingDates

In order to load Data_20190106_02_006.mat instead of TopoData_20190106_02_006.mat a function in the picker needs to be created that calculates psX and psY (from lat and lon).

Compute interruptions of merged layers.
